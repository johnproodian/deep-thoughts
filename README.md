# Deep Thoughts

A social media application where users can sign up, create an account, post their thoughts, and interact with other users.

## Note

This was created mostly from scratch (with the exception of some styling and front end components that were provided) by following a tutorial, but I only got a little more than halfway through--which was mostly the back end, but also the start of the front end.

When I returned to it to the project, I wanted to walk through the front end segments again, so I started a new repo using a "snapshot" of the tutorial's code from right before the front end portion started, and went on from there. In retrospect, I should have done a straight ```git revert```, but, alas, I took a more convoluted route.

Thus, finsihed project (if it has been finished) can be found at this repo (and the deployed app in its README, if its deployment exists yet):
